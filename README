This repo reflects my work for the fulfillment of Free Code Camp's intermediate front end development project: Use the Twitch.tv JSON API.  The following user stories were to be met:

User Story: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

User Story: I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed).
